Introduction
</b></p>	

<p>
The simulation can be used to visualise data by connecting to a relational data source such as an Oracle or MySQL database server. The visualisation works by associating each row of data with a shoal of fish in the simulation. The two main components of the fish's behaviour, their eyesight and speed, will then be directly influenced by the associated entity in the data source. The attributes of the different shoals will represent the relation between the different entities in the data source, rather than the exact values of the entities. For example, if the value of an entity is double the value of another entity, the attribute value of one shoal will be double the attribute value of another shoal and will lie within a specified range to ensure that the attributes are not too powerful or too weak. When connecting to a data source, the field to be used as the name of the shoal must be specified, as well as the field to be used as the attribute value of the shoal, known as the shoal performance measure. The shoal name can only be linked to a field of type text and the shoal performance measure can only be linked to a field of type integer. As with natural situations of competition, a group with better attributes will compete better for resources and therefore grow in numbers due to an increase in reproduction. This feature of competition is useful in knowing at a glance the level of performance of different entities by looking at the number of fish in the group. The value of the data entity that a shoal represents would therefore indirectly influence the size of the shoal.

<p><b>
Introduction
</b></p>	

<p>
In order to test the fish's problem solving skills, mazes can be added to the tank. Research shows that the more hungry a fish is, the more innovation it displays when carrying out problem solving tasks. Therefore, depending on the complexity of the maze, some fish will be able to solve the maze and some will get stuck. Solving the maze will give the fish access to a secret compartment of food at the end of the maze, thereby giving the hungrier fish a fair chance to survive. This concept works by allowing by the hungrier fish to use a method of searching called backtracking. When a fish reaches a dead end, the backtracking method allows it to trace it steps back to the point in the maze where it had more than one path to go. The fish then chooses the path it didn't choose the previous attempt and keeps repeating this process until it finds the end of the maze. 
</p>

<p>
The following diagram shows the different paths taken by a normal fish and a hungry fish. The normal fish reaches a dead end and stops there, the hungry fish also reaches the dead end but traces its steps back and tries a different path which leads to the end of the maze:

Introduction
</b></p>

<p>
All aspects of the simulation and tank can be fully customised, such as adding or removing shoals, changing the simulation mode and changing the simulation parameters etc. There are two simulation modes, foraging and predator mode. In the foraging mode food is distributed in random locations of the tank in regular intervals. As the fish consume the food, their energy increases. Once the collective energy of the entire shoal is over a certain amount, the shoal will reproduce. If the energy of a fish falls below a certain amount it will die. In the predator mode the fish are constantly reproducing and they cannot die due to a lack of energy, however, they can die by being eaten by a predator.

Introduction
</b></p>

<p>
In addition to the funcionality discussed above, the simulation can also be run as an educational support tool. The topic that it covers is a primary school science topic on habitats and in particular food chains(QCA Unit 4B). The educational support tool has three components, the learning component, activity and quiz. The learning component consists of a set of teaching slides that correspond to the national curriculum and should be shown to the children at the beginning of the lesson. The activity component runs a simulation of a natural habitat containing a food chaing of producers and consumers. The prey consume the plants available in the tank, which grow back in regular intervals, whilst the predators consume the prey. Any kind of consumption results in an increase in energy, once the collective energy of the entire shoal is over a certain amount, the shoal will reproduce. If the energy of a fish falls below a certain amount or it is consumed it will die. The activity allows the teacher to alter the environment by changing the number of plants, changing the attributes of the prey and changing the attributes of the predators. The purpose of the activity is to allow the children to see the effect of the environment on predator-prey cycles. The quiz component consists of a set of multiple choice and interactive questions that are based on the learning component of the tool.
